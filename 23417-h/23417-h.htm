    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am not naturally superstitious. The Saharaman is. He has many strange
      beliefs. When one is at close quarters with him, sees him day by day in
      his home, the great desert, listens to his dramatic tales of desert
      lights, visions, sounds, one&rsquo;s common-sense is apt to be shaken on its
      throne. Perhaps it is the influence of the solitude and the wide spaces,
      of those far horizons of the Sahara where the blue deepens along the edge
      of the world, that turns even a European mind to an Eastern credulity. Who
      can tell? The truth is that in the Sahara one can believe what one cannot
      believe in London. And sometimes circumstances&mdash;chance if you like to
      call it so&mdash;steps in, and seems to say, &ldquo;Your belief is well
      founded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of all the desert superstitions the one which appealed most to my
      imagination was the superstition of the desert drum. The Sahara-man
      declares that far away from the abodes of men and desert cities, among the
      everlasting sand dunes, the sharp beating, or dull, distant rolling of a
      drum sometimes breaks upon the ears of travellers voyaging through the
      desolation. They look around, they stare across the flats, they see
      nothing. But the mysterious music continues. Then, if they be Sahara-bred,
      they commend themselves to Allah, for they know that some terrible
      disaster is at hand, that one of them at least is doomed to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often had I heard stories of the catastrophes which were immediately
      preceded by the beating of the desert drum. One night in the Sahara I was
      a witness to one which I have never been able to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an evening of spring, accompanied by a young Arab and a negro, I rode
      slowly down a low hill of the Sahara, and saw in the sandy cup at my feet
      the tiny collection of hovels called Sidi-Massarli. I had been in the
      saddle since dawn, riding over desolate tracks in the heart of the desert.
      I was hungry, tired, and felt almost like a man hypnotised. The strong
      air, the clear sky, the everlasting flats devoid of vegetation, empty of
      humanity, the monotonous motion of my slowly cantering horse&mdash;all
      these things combined to dull my brain and to throw me into a peculiar
      condition akin to the condition of a man in a trance. At Sidi-Massarli I
      was to pass the night. I drew rein and looked down on it with lack-lustre
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a small group of palm-trees, guarded by a low wall of baked brown
      earth, in which were embedded many white bones of dead camels. Bleached,
      grinning heads of camels hung from more than one of the trees, with
      strings of red pepper and round stones. Beyond the wall of this palm
      garden, at whose foot was a furrow full of stagnant brownish-yellow water,
      lay a handful of wretched earthen hovels, with flat roofs of palmwood and
      low wooden doors. To be exact, I think there were five of them. The Bordj,
      or Travellers&rsquo; House, at which I was to be accommodated for the night,
      stood alone near a tiny source at the edge of a large sand dune, and was a
      small, earth-coloured building with a pink tiled roof, minute arched
      windows, and an open stable for the horses and mules. All round the desert
      rose in humps of sand, melting into stony ground where the saltpetre lay
      like snow on a wintry world. There were but few signs of life in this
      place; some stockings drying on the wall of a ruined Arab café, some kids
      frisking by a heap of sacks, a few pigeons circling about a low square
      watch-tower, a black donkey brooding on a dust heap. There were some signs
      of death; carcasses of camels stretched here and there in frantic and
      fantastic postures, some bleached and smooth, others red and horribly
      odorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind blew round this hospitable township of the Sahara, and the yellow
      light of evening began to glow above it. It seemed to me at that moment
      the dreariest place in the dreariest dream man had ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly my horse neighed loudly. Beyond the village, on the opposite
      hill, a white Arab charger caracoled, a red cloak gleamed. Another
      traveller was coming in to his night&rsquo;s rest, and he was a Spahi. I could
      almost fancy I heard the jingle of his spurs and accoutrements, the
      creaking of his tall red boots against his high peaked saddle. As he rode
      down towards the Bordj&mdash;by this time, I, too, was on my way&mdash;I
      saw that a long cord hung from his saddle-bow, and that at the end of this
      cord was a man, trotting heavily in the heavy sand like a creature dogged
      and weary. We came in to Sidi-Massarli simultaneously, and pulled up at
      the same moment before the arched door of the Bordj, from which glided a
      one-eyed swarthy Arab, staring fixedly at me. This was the official keeper
      of the house. In one hand he held the huge door key, and as I swung myself
      heavily on the ground I heard him, in Arabic, asking my Arab attendant,
      D&rsquo;oud, who I was and where I hailed from.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such attention as I had to bestow on anything just then was given to
      the Spahi and his companion. The Spahi was a magnificent man, tall, lithe,
      bronze-brown and muscular. He looked about thirty-four, and had the face
      of a desert eagle. His piercing black eyes stared me calmly out of
      countenance, and he sat on his spirited horse like a statue, waiting
      patiently till the guardian of the Bordj was ready to attend to him. My
      gaze travelled from him along the cord to the man at its end, and rested
      there with pity. He, too, was a fine specimen of humanity, a giant, nobly
      built, with a superbly handsome face, something like that of an undefaced
      Sphinx. Broad brows sheltered his enormous eyes. His rather thick lips
      were parted to allow his panting breath to escape, and his dark, almost
      black skin, was covered with sweat. Drops of sweat coursed down his bare
      arms and his mighty chest, from which his ragged burnous was drawn
      partially away. He was evidently of mixed Arab and negro parentage. As he
      stood by the Spain&rsquo;s horse, gasping, his face expressed nothing but
      physical exhaustion. His eyes were bent on the sand, and his arms hung
      down loosely at his sides. While I looked at him the Spahi suddenly gave a
      tug at the cord to which he was attached. He moved in nearer to the horse,
      glanced up at me, held out his hand, and said in a low, musical voice,
      speaking Arabic:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a cigarette, Sidi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened my case and gave him one, at the same time diplomatically handing
      another to the Spahi. Thus we opened our night&rsquo;s acquaintance, an
      acquaintance which I shall not easily forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the desolation of the Sahara a travelling intimacy is quickly formed.
      The one-eyed Arab led our horses to the stable, and while my two
      attendants were inside unpacking the tinned food and the wine I carried
      with me on a mule, I entered into conversation with the Spahi, who spoke
      French fairly well. He told me that he was on the way to El Arba, a long
      journey through the desert from Sidi-Massarli, and that his business was
      to convey there the man at the end of the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is he? A prisoner?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A murderer, monsieur,&rdquo; the Spahi replied calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked again at the man, who was wiping the sweat from his face with one
      huge hand. He smiled and made a gesture of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he understand French?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he committed murder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Tunis. He was a butcher there. He cut a man&rsquo;s throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, monsieur. Perhaps he was jealous. It is hot in Tunis in the
      summer. That was five years ago, and ever since he has been in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why are you taking him to El Arba?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came from there. He is released, but he is not allowed to live any
      more in Tunis. Ah, monsieur, he is mad at going, for he loves a
      dancing-girl, Aïchouch, who dances with the Jewesses in the café by the
      lake. He wanted even to stay in prison, if only he might remain in Tunis.
      He never saw her, but he was in the same town, you understand. That was
      something. All the first day he ran behind my horse cursing me for taking
      him away. But now the sand has got into his throat. He is so tired that he
      can scarcely run. So he does not curse any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captive giant smiled at me again. Despite his great stature, his
      powerful and impressive features, he looked, I thought, very gentle and
      submissive. The story of his passion for Aïchouch, his desire to be near
      her, even in a prison cell, had appealed to me. I pitied him sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;hammed Bouaziz. Mine is Said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was weary with riding and wanted to stretch my legs, and see what was to
      be seen of Sidi-Massarli ere evening quite closed in, so at this point I
      lit a cigar and prepared to stroll off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is going for a walk?&rdquo; asked the Spahi, fixing his eyes on my
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accompany monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or monsieur&rsquo;s cigar-case,&rdquo; I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that poor fellow,&rdquo; I said, pointing to the murderer. &ldquo;He is tired
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. He will come with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Spahi jerked the cord and we set out, the murderer creeping over the
      sand behind us like some exhausted animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time twilight was falling over the Sahara, a grim twilight, cold
      and grey. The wind was rising. In the night it blew half a gale, but at
      this hour there was only a strong breeze in which minute sand-grains
      danced. The murderer&rsquo;s feet were shod with patched slippers, and the sound
      of these slippers shuffling close behind me made me feel faintly uneasy.
      The Spahi stared at my cigar so persistently that I was obliged to offer
      him one. When I had done so, and he had loftily accepted it, I half turned
      towards the murderer. The Spahi scowled ferociously. I put my cigar-case
      back into my pocket. It is unwise to offend the powerful if your sympathy
      lies with the powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidi-Massarli was soon explored. It contained a Café Maure, into which I
      peered. In the coffee niche the embers glowed. One or two ragged Arabs sat
      hunched upon the earthen divans playing a game of cards. At least I should
      have my coffee after my tinned dinner. I was turning to go back to the
      Bordj when the extreme desolation of the desert around, now fading in the
      shadows of a moonless night, stirred me to a desire. Sidi-Massarli was
      dreary enough. Still it contained habitations, men. I wished to feel the
      blank, wild emptiness of this world, so far from the world of civilisation
      from which I had come, to feel it with intensity. I resolved to mount the
      low hill down which I had seen the Spahi ride, to descend into the fold of
      desert beyond it, to pause there a moment, out of sight of the hamlet,
      listen to the breeze, look at the darkening sky, feel the sand-grains
      stinging my cheeks, shake hands with the Sahara.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I wanted to shake hands quite alone. I therefore suggested to the
      Spahi that he should remain in the Café Maure and drink a cup of coffee at
      my expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is monsieur going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only over that hill for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accompany monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must be tired. A cup of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accompany monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Arab fashion he was establishing a claim upon me. On the morrow, when I
      was about to depart, he would point out that he had guided me round
      Sidi-Massarli, had guarded me in my dangerous expedition beyond its
      fascinations, despite his weariness and hunger. I knew how useless it is
      to contend with these polite and persistent rascals, so I said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the Spahi, the murderer and I stood in the fold of the
      sand dunes, and Sidi-Massarli was blotted from our sight.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The desolation here was complete. All around us lay the dunes, monstrous
      as still leviathans. Here and there, between their strange, suggestive
      shapes, under the dark sky one could see the ghastly whiteness of the
      saltpetre in the arid plains beyond, where the low bushes bent in the
      chilly breeze. I thought of London&mdash;only a few days&rsquo; journey from me&mdash;revelled
      for a moment in my situation, which, contrary to my expectation, was
      rather emphasised by the presence of my companions. The gorgeous Spahi,
      with his scarlet cloak and hood, his musket and sword, his high red
      leggings, the ragged, sweating captive in his patched burnous, ex-butcher
      looking, despite his cord emblem of bondage, like reigning Emperor&mdash;they
      were appropriate figures in this desert place. I had just thought this,
      and was regarding my Sackville Street suit with disgust, when a low,
      distinct and near sound suddenly rose from behind a sand dune on my left.
      It was exactly like the dull beating of a tom-tom. The silence preceding
      it had been intense, for the breeze was as yet too light to make more than
      the faintest sighing music, and in the gathering darkness this abrupt and
      gloomy noise produced, I supposed, by some hidden nomad, made a very
      unpleasant, even sinister impression upon me. Instinctively I put my hand
      on the revolver which was slung at my side in a pouch of gazelle skin. As
      I did so, I saw the Spahi turn sharply and gaze in the direction of the
      sound, lifting one hand to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low thunder of the instrument, beaten rhythmically and persistently,
      grew louder and was evidently drawing nearer. The musician must be
      climbing up the far side of the dune. I had swung round to face him, and
      expected every moment to see some wild figure appear upon the summit,
      defining itself against the cold and gloomy sky. But none came.
      Nevertheless, the noise increased till it was a roar, drew near till it
      was actually upon us. It seemed to me that I heard the sticks striking the
      hard, stretched skin furiously, as if some phantom drummer were stealthily
      encircling us, catching us in a net, a trap of horrible, vicious uproar.
      Instinctively I threw a questioning, perhaps an appealing, glance at my
      two companions. The Spahi had dropped his hand from his ear. He stood
      upright, as if at attention on the parade-ground of Biskra. His face was
      set&mdash;afterwards I told myself it was fatalistic. The murderer, on the
      other hand, was smiling. I remember the gleam of his big white teeth. Why
      was he smiling? While I asked myself the question the roar of the tom-tom
      grew gradually less, as if the man beating it were walking rapidly away
      from us in the direction of Sidi-Massarli. None of us said a word till
      only a faint, heavy throbbing, like the beating of a heart, I fancied, was
      audible in the darkness. Then I spoke, as silence fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it is no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Spain&rsquo;s voice was dry and soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it is the desert drum. There will be death in Sidi-Massarli
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt myself turn cold. He spoke with such conviction. The murderer was
      still smiling, and I noticed that the tired look had left him. He stood in
      an alert attitude, and the sweat had dried on his broad forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The desert drum?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has not heard of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have heard&mdash;but&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be. There must have been
      someone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the white teeth of the murderer, white as the saltpetre which
      makes winter in the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get back to the Bordj,&rdquo; I said abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accompany monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old formula, and this time the voice which spoke it sounded natural.
      We went forward together. I walked very fast. I wanted to catch up that
      music, to prove to myself that it was produced by human fists and sticks
      upon an instrument which, however barbarous, had been fashioned by human
      hands. But we entered Sidi-Massarli in a silence, only broken by the
      soughing of the wind and the heavy shuffle of the murderer&rsquo;s feet upon the
      sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the Café Maure D&rsquo;oud was standing with the white hood of his
      burnous drawn forward over his head; one or two ragged Arabs stood with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been playing tom-toms in the village, D&rsquo;oud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur asks if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom-toms. Can&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Monsieur is laughing. Tom-toms here! And dancers, too, perhaps!
      Monsieur thinks there are dancers? Fatma and Khadija and Aïchouch&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced quickly at the murderer as D&rsquo;oud mentioned the last name, a name
      common to many dancers of the East. I think I expected to see upon his
      face some tremendous expression, a revelation of the soul of the man who
      had run for one whole day through the sand behind the Spahi&rsquo;s horse,
      cursing at the end of the cord which dragged him onward from Tunis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I only met the gentle smile of eyes so tender, so submissive, that
      they were as the eyes of a woman who had always been a slave, while the
      ragged Arabs laughed at the idea of tom-toms in Sidi-Massarli.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When we reached the Bordj I found that it contained only one good-sized
      room, quite bare, with stone floor and white walls. Here, upon a deal
      table, was set forth my repast; the foods I had brought with me, and a red
      Arab soup served in a gigantic bowl of palmwood. A candle guttered in the
      glass neck of a bottle, and upon the floor were already spread my gaudy
      striped quilt, my pillow, and my blanket. The Spahi surveyed these
      preparations with a deliberate greediness, lingering in the narrow
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down on a bench before the table. My attendants were to eat at the
      Café Maure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to sleep?&rdquo; I asked of D&rsquo;oud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Café Maure, monsieur, if monsieur is not afraid to sleep alone.
      Here is the key. Monsieur can lock himself in. The door is strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was helping myself to the soup. The rising wind blew up the skirts of
      the Spahi&rsquo;s scarlet robe. In the wind&mdash;was it imagination?&mdash;I
      seemed to hear some thin, passing echoes of a tom-tom&rsquo;s beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; I said to the Spahi. &ldquo;You shall sup with me to-night, and&mdash;and
      you shall sleep here with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;oud&rsquo;s expressive face became sinister. Arabs are almost as jealous as
      they are vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, he will sleep in the Café Maure. If monsieur wishes for a
      companion, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; I repeated to the Spahi. &ldquo;You can sleep here to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Spahi stepped over the lintel with a jingling of spurs, a rattling of
      accoutrements. The murderer stepped in softly after him, drawn by the
      cord. D&rsquo;oud began to look as grim as death. He made a ferocious gesture
      towards the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that man? Monsieur wishes to sleep in the same room with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard the sound of the tom-tom above the wail of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did I wish it? I hardly know. I had no fear for, no desire to protect
      myself. But I remembered the smile I had seen, the Spahi&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;There
      will be death in Sidi-Massarli to-night,&rdquo; and I was resolved that the
      three men who had heard the desert drum together should not be parted till
      the morning. D&rsquo;oud said no more. He waited upon me with his usual
      diligence, but I could see that he was furiously angry. The Spahi ate
      ravenously. So did the murderer, who more than once, however, seemed to be
      dropping to sleep over his food. He was apparently dead tired. As the wind
      was now become very violent I did not feel disposed to stir out again, and
      I ordered D&rsquo;oud to bring us three cups of coffee to the Bordj. He cast a
      vicious look at the Spahi and went out into the darkness. I saw him no
      more that night. A boy from the Café Maure brought us coffee, cleared the
      remains of our supper from the table, and presently muttered some Arab
      salutation, departed, and was lost in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murderer was now frankly asleep with his head upon the table, and the
      Spahi began to blink. I, too, felt very tired, but I had something still
      to say. Speaking softly, I said to the Spahi:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sound we heard to-night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard it before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, monsieur. But my brother heard it just before he had a stroke of
      the sun. He fell dead before his captain beside the wall of Sada. He was a
      tirailleur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think this sound means that death is near?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, monsieur. All desert people know it. I was born at Touggourt,
      and how should I not know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then one of us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked from him to the sleeping murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be death in Sidi-Massarli tonight, monsieur. It is the will of
      Allah. Blessed be Allah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got up, locked the heavy door of the Bordj, and put the key in the inner
      pocket of my coat. As I did so, I fancied I saw the heavy black lids of
      the murderer&rsquo;s closed eyes flutter for a moment. But I cannot be sure. My
      head was aching with fatigue. The Spahi, too, looked stupid with sleep. He
      jerked the cord, the murderer awoke with a start, glanced heavily round,
      stood up. Pulling him as one would an obstinate dog, the Spahi made him
      lie down on the bare floor in the corner of the Bordj, ere he himself
      curled up in the thick quilt which had been rolled up behind his high
      saddle. I made no protest, but when the Spahi was asleep, his lean brown
      hand laid upon his sword, his musket under his shaven head, I pushed one
      of my blankets over to the murderer, who lay looking like a heap of rags
      against the white wall. He smiled at me gently, as he had smiled when the
      desert drum was beating, and drew the blanket over his mighty limbs and
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not mean to sleep that night. Tired though I was my brain was so
      excited that I felt I should not. I blew out the candle without even the
      thought that it would be necessary to struggle against sleep. And in the
      darkness I heard for an instant the roar of the wind outside, the heavy
      breathing of my two strange companions within. For an instant&mdash;then
      it seemed as if a shutter was drawn suddenly over the light in my brain.
      Blackness filled the room where the thoughts develop, crowd, stir in
      endless activities. Slumber fell upon me like a great stone that strikes a
      man down to dumbness, to unconsciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far in the night I had a dream. I cannot recall it accurately now. I could
      not recall it even the next morning when I awoke. But in this dream, it
      seemed to me that fingers felt softly about my heart. I was conscious of
      their fluttering touch. It was as if I were dead, and as if the doctor
      laid for a moment his hand upon my heart to convince himself that the
      pulse of life no longer beat. And this action wove itself naturally into
      the dream I had. The fingers so soft, so surreptitious, were lifted from
      my breast, and I sank deeper into the gulf of sleep, below the place of
      dreams. For I was a tired man that night. At the first breath of dawn I
      stirred and woke. It was cold. I put out one hand and drew up my quilt.
      Then I lay still. The wind had sunk. I no longer heard it roaring over the
      desert. For a moment I hardly remembered where I was, then memory came
      back and I listened for the deep breathing of the Spahi and the murderer.
      Even when the wind blew I had heard it. I did not hear it now. I lay there
      under my quilt for some minutes listening. The silence was intense. Had
      they gone already, started on their way to El Arba? The Bordj was in
      darkness, for the windows were very small, and dawn had scarcely begun to
      break outside and had not yet filtered in through the wooden shutters
      which barred them. I disliked this complete silence, and felt about for
      the matches I had laid beside the candle before turning in. I could not
      find them. Someone had moved them, then. The heaviness of sleep had quite
      left me now, and I remembered clearly all the incidents of the previous
      evening. The roll of the desert drum sounded again in my ears. I threw off
      my quilt, got up, and moved softly over the stone floor towards the corner
      where the murderer had lain down to sleep. I bent down to touch him and
      touched the stone. They had gone, then! It was strange that I had not been
      waked by their departure. Besides, I had the key of the door. I thrust my
      hand into the breast-pocket of my coat which I had worn while I slept. The
      key was no longer there. Then I remembered my dream and the fingers
      fluttering round my heart. Stumbling in the blackness I came to the place
      where the Spahi had lain, stretched out my hands and felt naked flesh. My
      hands recoiled from it, for it was very cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour later the one-eyed Arab who kept the Bordj, roused by my
      beating upon the door with the butt end of my revolver, came with D&rsquo;oud to
      ask what was the matter. The door had to be broken in. This took some
      time. Long before I could escape, the light of the sun, entering through
      the little arched windows, had illumined the nude corpse of the Spahi, the
      gaping red wound in his throat, the heap of murderer&rsquo;s rags that lay
      across his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      M&rsquo;hammed Bouaziz, in the red cloak, the red boots, sword at his side,
      musket slung over his shoulder, was galloping over the desert on his way
      to freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But six months later he was taken at night outside a café by the lake at
      Tunis. He was gazing through the doorway at a girl who was posturing to
      the sound of pipes between two rows of Arabs. The light from the café fell
      upon his face, the dancer uttered a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;hammed Bouaziz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aïchouch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The law avenged the Spahi, and this time it was not to prison they led my
      friend of Sidi-Massarli, but to an open space before a squad of soldiers
      just when the dawn was breaking.
